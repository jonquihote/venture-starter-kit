# Requirements List Example

A well-structured requirements list provides clarity on what features to build, in what order, and with what level of detail. Use priority levels to guide development focus and resource allocation.

## TaskFlow MVP Requirements

### Priority Levels

- **P0 (Must Have)** - Core features required for launch
- **P1 (Should Have)** - Important features that enhance value
- **P2 (Nice to Have)** - Desirable features for future iterations

| R17 | Dark mode | ‚ùå | Toggle between light and dark themes |
| R18 | Calendar view | ‚ùå | Monthly calendar showing task due dates |
| R19 | Recurring tasks | ‚ùå | Templates that auto-create on schedule |
| R20 | Custom fields | ‚ùå | User-defined metadata fields |
| R21 | Time estimates vs actual | ‚ùå | Compare estimated vs tracked time |

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Example: Create Task Feature (R02)

**Functional Requirements:**
- User can create a task with title (required) and description (optional)
- Task is automatically assigned to the creator by default
- Task appears immediately on the board without page refresh
- Task title limited to 200 characters with validation
- Rich text formatting available in description (bold, italic, links)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time updates via WebSocket for collaborative editing
- Data validation on both client and server side
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Task creation completes within 500ms
- Supports concurrent task creation by multiple users
- Works offline with sync when connection restored

### Example: Time Tracking Feature (R07)

**User Flows:**
1. User clicks "Start Timer" on any task
2. Timer begins counting elapsed time
3. If another timer is running, it stops automatically
4. User can stop timer manually or switch to another task
5. Time entry is saved with start/end timestamps

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle browser refresh during active timer
- Prevent negative time entries
- Handle timezone differences for remote teams
- Maximum session length (8 hours auto-stop)

## Requirements Traceability

| Feature | Epic | User Story | Test Case |
|---------|------|------------|-----------|
| Task Creation | Task Management | TF-001 | TC-001, TC-002 |
| Time Tracking | Productivity | TF-007 | TC-015, TC-016 |
| Team Collaboration | Workspace | TF-009 | TC-025, TC-026 |

## Requirements Management Process

### Adding New Requirements
1. **Business justification** - Why is this needed?
2. **Priority assignment** - P0/P1/P2 classification
3. **Effort estimation** - Story points or time estimate
4. **Stakeholder approval** - Product owner sign-off
5. **Documentation** - Add to requirements list

### Changing Requirements
1. **Impact assessment** - What will be affected?
2. **Timeline implications** - How does this affect delivery?
3. **Resource reallocation** - Team capacity considerations
4. **Stakeholder notification** - Communicate changes
5. **Documentation update** - Maintain accurate records

### Acceptance Process
- **Demo criteria** - How will feature be demonstrated?
- **Testing requirements** - Unit, integration, and user acceptance tests
- **Performance benchmarks** - Speed and reliability standards
- **Documentation** - User guides and technical documentation

## Status Legend

- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Feature implemented and tested
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **In Development** - Currently being built
- ‚ùå **Not Started** - Planned for future sprint
- üîÑ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or decisions
- üö´ **Cancelled** - Removed from scope

Regular requirement reviews ensure the project stays aligned with business goals and user needs while maintaining development focus and preventing scope creep.
