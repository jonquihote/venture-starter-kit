# View Account

**I want to** view detailed account information in a read-only format
**So that** I can review account data, credentials, and relationships without making changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Display account information in a structured, read-only infolist
- [x] Show account name, username, and email fields clearly
- [x] Display credential relationships and verification status
- [x] Present data in an organized, accessible format
- [x] Include actions for editing and other account management
- [x] Support responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Infolist Structure

- **Location**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Pages/ViewAccount.php`
- **Schema**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Schemas/AccountInfolist.php`
- **Display Fields**: name, username.value, email.value, created_at, updated_at
- **Organization**: Grouped by logical sections for clarity

### Data Presentation

**Account Information Section**:

- **Name**: Account's display name
- **Created**: Account creation timestamp
- **Updated**: Last modification timestamp

**Credential Information Section**:

- **Username**: Primary username credential value
- **Email**: Primary email credential value
- **Verification Status**: Credential verification timestamps

**Account Actions**:

- Edit Account (basic information)
- Edit Password (separate action)
- Edit Roles (role management)
- Account activity and audit trail

### Relationship Display

**Primary Credentials**:

```php
// Infolist displays primary credentials via relationships
$account->username->value    // Primary username credential
$account->email->value       // Primary email credential
```

**Credential Details**:

- Credential type (username/email)
- Primary designation status
- Verification timestamps
- Creation and update times

## Additional Information Display

*These features are documented but testing focuses on core Account/AccountCredential display:*

### Team Relationships

- **Current Team**: Display current team assignment
- **Team Memberships**: List all team memberships with roles
- **Owned Teams**: Teams where account is the owner
- **Team History**: Membership changes and role updates

### Activity Information

- **Last Login**: Authentication timestamp tracking
- **Activity Log**: User actions and system interactions
- **Permission History**: Role and permission changes
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive change tracking

### Security Details

- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts and sessions
- **Permission Grants**: Current and historical permissions
- **Security Flags**: Account status and restrictions
- **Verification Status**: Email and credential verification

- ⚠️ **Not Tested** - Should be tested but currently isn't
- ❌ **Deferred** - Intentionally not implemented/tested yet

### Infolist Rendering and Structure *(Status: Core Tested)*

1. ✅ View account page can be rendered successfully
2. ⚠️ Infolist displays with proper structure and sections *(Not explicitly tested)*
3. ✅ Account name is displayed correctly
4. ✅ Username credential value is shown
5. ✅ Email credential value is shown
6. ⚠️ Created and updated timestamps are formatted properly *(Not tested)*

### Credential Relationship Display *(Status: Basic Coverage)*

1. ✅ Primary username credential displayed via relationship
2. ✅ Primary email credential displayed via relationship
3. ⚠️ Credential verification status shown when available *(Not tested)*
4. ✅ Multiple credential types supported in display *(Implicit through username/email tests)*
5. ✅ Credential relationships work correctly *(Implicit through display tests)*

### Data Formatting and Organization *(Status: Framework Dependent)*

1. ⚠️ Information grouped logically in sections *(Not tested)*
2. 🔧 Responsive design works on different screen sizes *(Framework feature)*
3. ⚠️ Dates and times formatted consistently *(Not tested)*
4. ✅ Empty states handled gracefully *(Tested via minimal data test)*
5. 🔧 Loading states display appropriately *(Framework feature)*

### Account Actions and Navigation *(Status: Not Tested)*

*Note: Testing focuses on core Account/AccountCredential display functionality. The ViewAccountTest.php file contains
only 5 basic tests: page rendering, display of account name/username/email, handling accounts with only username or
email credentials, and graceful handling of minimal data. Advanced features like timestamps, actions, and team
information are not currently tested.*
