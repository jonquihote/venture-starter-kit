# View Account

**I want to** view detailed account information in a read-only format
**So that** I can review account data, credentials, and relationships without making changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Display account information in a structured, read-only infolist
- [x] Show account name, username, and email fields clearly
- [x] Display credential relationships and verification status
- [x] Present data in an organized, accessible format
- [x] Include actions for editing and other account management
- [x] Support responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Infolist Structure

- **Location**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Pages/ViewAccount.php`
- **Schema**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Schemas/AccountInfolist.php`
- **Display Fields**: name, username.value, email.value
- **Organization**: Grouped by logical sections for clarity

### Data Presentation

**Account Information Section**:

- **Name**: Account's display name
- **Username**: Primary username credential value  
- **Email**: Primary email credential value

**Team and Role Tabs** *(when teams exist)*:

- **Team Tabs**: One tab per team (owned and membership)
- **Owner Badge**: Shows "Owner" badge for owned teams
- **Role Display**: Role checkboxes within each team tab

**Account Actions**:

- Edit Account (basic information)
- Edit Password (separate action)
- Edit Roles (role management)
- Account activity and audit trail

### Relationship Display

**Primary Credentials**:

```php
// Infolist displays primary credentials via relationships
$account->username->value    // Primary username credential
$account->email->value       // Primary email credential
```

**Note**: The infolist displays only basic account information (name) and credential values (username, email) through relationships. Timestamps, verification status, and other details are not currently displayed in the view.

## Additional Information Display

*These features are documented but testing focuses on core Account/AccountCredential display:*

### Team Relationships

- **Current Team**: Display current team assignment
- **Team Memberships**: List all team memberships with roles
- **Owned Teams**: Teams where account is the owner
- **Team History**: Membership changes and role updates

### Activity Information

- **Last Login**: Authentication timestamp tracking
- **Activity Log**: User actions and system interactions
- **Permission History**: Role and permission changes
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive change tracking

### Security Details

- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts and sessions
- **Permission Grants**: Current and historical permissions
- **Security Flags**: Account status and restrictions
- **Verification Status**: Email and credential verification

## Test Scenarios - View Account

**Legend:**

- ✅ **Tested** - Explicitly tested in our test suite
- 🔧 **Framework** - Provided by Filament framework, not explicitly tested
- ⚠️ **Not Tested** - Should be tested but currently isn't

2. ✅ Infolist displays with proper schema structure
3. ✅ Account name is displayed correctly
4. ✅ Username credential value is shown
5. ✅ Email credential value is shown
6. ❌ Created and updated timestamps *(Not implemented in infolist)*

### Credential Relationship Display *(Status: Comprehensively Tested)*

2. ✅ Primary email credential displayed via relationship
3. ❌ Credential verification status *(Not displayed in infolist)*
4. ✅ Multiple credential types supported in display *(Tested with different combinations)*
5. ✅ Credential relationships work correctly *(Explicitly tested with assertSchemaStateSet)*
6. ✅ Handles missing credentials gracefully *(null values tested)*

### Data Formatting and Organization *(Status: Tested & Framework Dependent)*

2. 🔧 Responsive design works on different screen sizes *(Framework feature)*
3. ❌ Dates and times formatting *(No timestamps displayed)*
4. ✅ Empty states handled gracefully *(Tested with accounts with no teams/credentials)*
5. 🔧 Loading states display appropriately *(Framework feature)*

### Account Actions and Navigation *(Status: Comprehensively Tested)*

2. ✅ Edit Password action available where authorized *(Tested with assertActionExists)*
3. ✅ Edit Roles action available where authorized *(Tested with assertActionExists)*
4. ✅ All actions visible when user has permissions *(Tested with assertActionVisible)*
5. ✅ Action authorization respected properly *(Tested with action existence checks)*

### Team and Activity Information *(Status: Deferred)*

1. ❌ Current team information displayed when available *(Deferred - feature exists but testing deferred)*
2. ❌ Team membership data shown correctly *(Deferred)*
3. ❌ Activity timestamps and events displayed *(Deferred)*
4. ❌ Permission and role information accessible *(Deferred)*

## Current Test Coverage

The ViewAccountTest.php file now contains **16 comprehensive tests** organized in logical groups:

### Basic Display Tests (5 tests)
- Page rendering and basic data display
- Handling different credential combinations
- Graceful handling of minimal data

### Infolist Data Display (4 tests)  
- Schema state validation with `assertSchemaStateSet()`
- Missing credentials handling
- Individual credential type testing

### Infolist Structure (3 tests)
- Schema existence validation  
- Section component testing
- Empty state handling

### Header Actions (4 tests)
- Edit, Edit Password, Edit Roles action existence
- Action visibility testing

**Total Coverage**: Core infolist functionality, credential relationships, basic team structure (when present), and header actions are all comprehensively tested. Team role details and advanced features remain deferred as they require complex setup.
