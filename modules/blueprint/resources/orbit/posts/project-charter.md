# Project Charter Example

A project charter serves as the foundation document that establishes project authority, defines scope, and sets initial parameters. It answers the fundamental questions: Why are we doing this? What are we building? Who's involved?

## Example: TaskFlow Project Charter

**Project Name:** TaskFlow - Team Task Management Platform  
**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Project Sponsor:** Sarah Chen, VP Product  
**Project Manager:** Alex Rivera  

### Problem Statement

Small marketing and design teams (5-15 people) struggle with existing task management tools that are either too simple (missing features like dependencies and time tracking) or too complex (requiring extensive training and setup). This results in 40% of teams reverting to spreadsheets within 3 months of adoption.

### Proposed Solution

Build a task management platform that hits the "goldilocks zone" - more powerful than Todoist but simpler than Jira. Core focus on visual task boards, simple dependency management, and built-in time tracking without complexity.

### Success Criteria

- Launch MVP with 10 beta customers by April 30, 2025
- Achieve 70% daily active usage rate among beta users
- Average onboarding time under 10 minutes without training
- User satisfaction score >4.2/5.0

### Scope Definition

**In Scope:**
- Web application development
- iOS mobile application
- Core task management features
- Time tracking functionality
- Team collaboration tools
- Slack integration

**Out of Scope:**
- Android app (Phase 2)
- Invoicing capabilities
- Resource planning features
- Gantt chart functionality

### Timeline & Budget

| Phase | Duration | Budget | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|---------|------------------|
| Phase 1 (MVP) | Jan 15 - Apr 30 (3.5 months) | $150,000 | Web app, iOS app, core features |
| Phase 2 (Full Launch) | May 1 - Jul 31 (3 months) | $100,000 | Android app, advanced features |

### Core Team

| Role | Name | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| Project Manager | Alex Rivera | Overall coordination, timeline management |
| Lead Developer | Jordan Kim | Technical leadership, architecture decisions |
| UX Designer | Casey Patel | User experience design, usability testing |
| Backend Developer | Morgan Lee | Server-side development, API design |
| QA Lead | Taylor Smith | Testing strategy, quality assurance |

### Key Assumptions

- Target users have basic technical proficiency
- Integration with existing Slack workspaces is essential
- Mobile usage will be primarily iOS in initial phase
- Teams are willing to migrate from current solutions

### Major Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Competitor launches similar product | High | Accelerate timeline, focus on unique features |
| Key developer leaves team | Medium | Cross-train team members, document thoroughly |
| Technical complexity exceeds estimates | Medium | Build MVP first, iterate on complex features |
| User adoption slower than expected | High | Extensive beta testing, user feedback loops |

### Approval and Sign-off

| Stakeholder | Role | Signature | Date |
|-------------|------|-----------|------|
| Sarah Chen | Executive Sponsor | _________________ | _______ |
| Alex Rivera | Project Manager | _________________ | _______ |
| Jordan Kim | Tech Lead | _________________ | _______ |

## Charter Template Guidelines

When creating your own project charter:

1. **Keep it concise** - Aim for 2-3 pages maximum
2. **Be specific** - Vague statements lead to scope creep
3. **Include measurable criteria** - Define success quantitatively
4. **Get formal approval** - Ensure stakeholder sign-off
5. **Reference regularly** - Use it to guide decisions throughout the project

The charter is a living document that may be updated as the project evolves, but changes should be formally approved by stakeholders.
