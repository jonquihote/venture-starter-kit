# Edit Account

**I want to** update existing account information including name, username, and email
**So that** I can maintain accurate account data while preserving existing credentials and relationships

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Form displays current account data for name, username, and email
- [x] Name validation using ValidName rule (ASCII characters only)
- [x] Username validation using ValidUsername rule with proper constraints
- [x] Email format validation with uniqueness checking
- [x] Username and email uniqueness excludes current account's credentials
- [x] Credential updates use trait helper methods
- [x] Primary credential designation is maintained during updates
- [x] Successful updates show notification and redirect appropriately

## Technical Implementation

### Form Structure

- **Location**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Pages/EditAccount.php`
- **Schema**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Schemas/AccountForm.php`
- **Form Fields**: name, username.value, email.value (no password fields)
- **Pre-population**: Current values loaded from account and primary credentials

### Update Process

**Account Update Flow**:

1. Account name updated directly on Account model
2. Username updated via trait helper method
3. Email updated via trait helper method
4. Primary credential designation preserved

- Length: 4-16 characters
- Must start with lowercase letter (a-z)
- Must end with letter or number
- Allowed characters: lowercase letters, numbers, periods, underscores
- No consecutive special characters (dots/underscores)
- Uniqueness excludes current account's username credential

**Email Field**:

- Standard email format validation
- Uniqueness excludes current account's email credential
- Proper handling of update scenarios
