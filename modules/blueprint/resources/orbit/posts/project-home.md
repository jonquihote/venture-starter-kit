# Home

This section contains comprehensive project documentation examples following industry best practices. The documentation
is organized into three main stages:

## Stage 1: Foundation Documents

Essential planning documents that establish project fundamentals.

- **[Project Charter](project-charter)** - Problem statement, solution, scope, timeline, and team
- **[Requirements List](project-requirements)** - Prioritized features with acceptance criteria
- **[Technical Feasibility](project-technical-feasibility)** - Technology stack assessment and risk analysis

## Stage 2: Design Documents

Architecture and design specifications that guide development.

- **[System Architecture](project-architecture)** - High-level system design and key decisions
- **[UI/UX Design](project-ui-ux-design)** - Wireframes, user flows, and interface patterns
- **[Database Design](project-database-design)** - Schema design and data relationships
- **[API Specification](project-api-specification)** - Endpoint documentation and contracts

## Stage 3: Development Documents

Implementation guides and development workflows.

- **[User Stories](project-user-stories)** - Detailed feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- **[README Guide](project-readme)** - Setup instructions and development workflow
- **[Test Plan](project-test-plan)** - Testing strategy, scenarios, and quality assurance

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Don't copy verbatim** - These are starting points. Adapt them to your specific project needs.
2. **Start simpler** - If these feel too detailed, use simplified versions. Better to have basic documentation than
   none.
3. **Use real data** - Replace example content with your actual project details.
4. **Iterate** - Update documentation as your project evolves and you learn more.
5. **Share early** - Get feedback from your team before spending too much time perfecting.

The goal isn't perfect documentation, but *useful* documentation that helps your team build the right thing efficiently.
