## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PHP** 8.4 or higher
- **Node.js** v22+ (with bun as primary package manager)
- **Composer** for PHP dependencies
- **Git** for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> venture
   cd venture
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   bun install
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   composer dev
   ```

The `composer dev` command starts all development services concurrently:

- Laravel Horizon (queue processing)
- Task Scheduler
- Laravel Pail (log viewer)
- Vite dev server (asset compilation)
- Laravel Pulse (application monitoring)
- Laravel Reverb (WebSocket server)

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

**Development Server**

```bash
composer dev          # Start all development services
composer dev:ssr       # Start with server-side rendering
```

**Testing**

```bash
composer test          # Run all tests (parallel execution)
composer test:api      # Run API-specific tests
php artisan test --parallel
```

**Code Quality**

```bash
composer cs           # Run all code style tools
composer pint         # PHP code formatting
composer rector       # PHP code modernization
bun run lint          # JavaScript/TypeScript linting
bun run format        # Prettier formatting
```

**Asset Management**

```bash
bun run build        # Production asset build
bun run build:ssr    # Build with SSR support
```

**Module Management**

```bash
php artisan module:make ModuleName
php artisan module:enable ModuleName
php artisan module:migrate ModuleName
```

### Testing Strategy

The application uses **Pest v4** with comprehensive testing coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual class and method testing
- **Feature Tests**: Full application workflow testing
- **Browser Tests**: End-to-end user interaction testing
- **API Tests**: Separated API endpoint validation

Test configuration supports both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (testing) databases with parallel execution for
speed.

### Code Quality Standards

**Automated Quality Checks**

- **PHP**: Laravel Pint with strict import rules
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier with Blade support
- **Commits**: Conventional commit format enforced
- **Pre-commit**: Husky hooks ensure quality before commits

**Quality Metrics**

- Code coverage tracking
- Static analysis with Rector
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Performance monitoring with Pulse

## Best Practices

- Use module-specific service providers
- Implement proper event/observer patterns
- Maintain module isolation and clear interfaces

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Use factories for test data generation
- Implement browser tests for user workflows
- Maintain high code coverage standards

### Code Organization

- Group related functionality in modules
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Follow Laravel and Vue.js best practices
- Document complex business logic

### Performance Optimization

- Leverage Laravel's built-in caching
- Optimize database queries with eager loading
- Use queue processing for heavy operations
- Monitor performance with Laravel Pulse

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DB_CONNECTION`: Database type (sqlite/pgsql)
- `QUEUE_CONNECTION`: Queue driver configuration
- `BROADCAST_DRIVER`: WebSocket configuration

### Module Configuration

Each module includes its own configuration files and service providers. Module-specific settings can be found in
`config/modules.php` and individual module config directories.

### Package Configuration

Pre-configured packages include optimized settings for:

- Horizon (queue monitoring)
