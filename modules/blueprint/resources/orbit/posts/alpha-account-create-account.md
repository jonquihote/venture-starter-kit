# Create Account

**I want to** create new user accounts with secure credentials
**So that** I can onboard users into the system with proper validation and security measures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Form displays fields for name, password, password confirmation, username, and email
- [x] All fields are required and properly validated
- [x] Name validation using ValidName rule (ASCII characters only)
- [x] Password requires minimum 12 characters with confirmation
- [x] Username validation using ValidUsername rule (4-16 chars, specific format)
- [x] Email format validation and uniqueness checking
- [x] AccountCredential records created with proper type and primary designation
- [x] Successful creation redirects with notification

## Technical Implementation

### Form Structure
- **Location**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Pages/CreateAccount.php`
- **Schema**: `modules/alpha/app/Filament/Clusters/Administration/Resources/Accounts/Schemas/AccountForm.php`
- **Form Fields**: name, password, password_confirmation, username.value, email.value
- **Validation**: Uses Laravel form requests with custom validation rules

### Validation Rules

**Name Field (ValidName)**:
- ASCII characters only (A-Z, a-z, spaces)
- Must contain at least one letter (not just spaces)
- No special characters or numbers

**Password Field**:
- Minimum 12 characters using Laravel's `Password::min(12)` rule
- Confirmation required matching password field
- Secure hashing using Laravel's default hasher

**Username Field (ValidUsername)**:
- Length: 4-16 characters
- Must start with lowercase letter (a-z)
- Must end with letter or number
- Allowed characters: lowercase letters, numbers, periods, underscores
- No consecutive special characters (dots/underscores)
- Uniqueness within username credential type

**Email Field**:
- Standard email format validation
- Uniqueness within email credential type
- Proper handling during creation

### Credential Creation Process

**Account Creation Flow**:
1. Account record created with name and hashed password
2. Username credential created with type='username', is_primary=true
3. Email credential created with type='email', is_primary=true
4. Both credentials linked to account via account_id
5. Verification timestamps set appropriately

### Password Security
- All passwords hashed using Laravel's default hasher
- Secure password generation for CSV imports (32-character random)
- Password confirmation required for all operations

## Additional Features

*These features are documented but testing is deferred:*

### CSV Import Capability
- **Field Mapping**: name, username, email columns required
- **Validation**: Full validation using custom rules (ValidName, ValidUsername)
- **Uniqueness Enforcement**: Username/email uniqueness within credential types
- **Secure Password Generation**: 32-character random passwords auto-generated
- **Credential Creation**: Automatic AccountCredential records with primary designation
- **Error Handling**: Detailed validation messages and failure tracking
